<h1>My Favorite</h1>
<p>King Von is my favorite musician because he's a storyteller. A lot of rappers talk about what it's like growing up where they are from
and who they are. King Von does it but in his own way. He tells stories about those kinds of things. He always makes it sound so good while doing it. He does use a lot of profanity but I dont mind it because its something everybody hears almost everyday.
    He even has 2 songs talking about what it's like being arrested and the process of it and what it's like living like he did and in the conditions he did. I will link them but just be aware that there is a lot of profanity.
